    The Monkey is a program that runs on your emulator/device and generates pseudo-random
    streams of user events such as clicks, touches, or gestures, as well as a number of system-level
    events.  You can use the Monkey to stress-test applications that you are developing, in a random
    yet repeatable manner.

    Orangutan is a replacement for Android's monkey/monkeyrunner tool,intended to
    overcome the following limitations:
    Lack of ability to realistically simulate input events: it is
    difficult to impossible to accurately simulate touch events in terms
    of downtime and event time. The TCP/IP protocol does not currently
    set the down time for events correctly, which can result in swipes
    being misinterpreted as long presses. Running a monkey script these
    values are set automatically, but not in a way that all applications
    can understand: for example, Google Chrome for Android totally
    ignores a monkey-generated drag event.Difficult to impossible to fix
    bugs. Theoretically it may be possible to submit patches upstream,
    but good luck getting a patched version of monkeyrunner on a device
    running Android 2.x.
